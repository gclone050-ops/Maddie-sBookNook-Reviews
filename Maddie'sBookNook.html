		<p> "The Girl in the Blue Coat" by Monica Hesse was an emotionally charged book that left me on the brink of my seat. Hanneke's perseverance throughout adversity was extremely interesting. Hanneke's journey searching for Mirjam's allows readers to explore a side of the resistance during World War II. It was extremely surprising finding out that Mirjam was hiding in plain sight and pretending to be another girl. The story ending in which Mirjam dies is especially sad, however adds complexity and interesting plot lines to the story. I loved every part of this book! Could not recommend it more! </p>

		<p> "Betting on You" by Lynn Painter was one of the most entertaining books I've ever read! While an easy read, the book was very enjoyable and kept me entertained. The novel explores the love story between Bailey and Charlie who bond over their parents' divorces. At first the two find themselves at odds. However, after beginning working together they begin to become friends. They eventually decide to fake date to separate Bailey's mom and her new boyfriend. I loved the slow build up of Bailey and Charlie's relationship! I finished the book in less than 2 days because of how hard it was to put down. I highly recommend it for someone looking for a quick and easy read.</p>

		<p> "A Good Girls Guide to Murder" by Holly Jackson was a book I could NOT put down! I absolutely loved the storytelling in "A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, a.k.a. AGGGTM. I had no idea who the killer was going to be or how the story was going to pan out. I finished the book in about a day and it was a very easy and relaxing read. Pip is an extremely interesting character, different to what you would see in typical literature. Ravi and Pip bond over working together and eventually date, and the lead-up to their dating is very cute and subtle. I would highly recommend the novel as an introduction to murder-mystery literature.</p>
